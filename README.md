# SafetyProxy

SafetyProxy plugin is coming to us!

SafetyProxy is project like BungeeGuard (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bungeeguard.79601/) which protects your
network servers (connected to WaterdogPE proxy) against direct connections. SafetyProxy requires NATS or Redis server to
run and synchronize data between WaterdogPE and Nukkit servers. There's no ENCRYPTION KEYS like in BungeeGuard,
SafetyProxy will do everything for you automatically via configured messaging service, so no one can connect to you
nukkit servers without joining via WaterdogPE.</br>

This project will be also available for BungeeCord (and it's forks like Waterfall) and Bukkit-based servers as a
alternative for BungeeGuard. We are planning many features like logs in gui (about failed direct connects) and many
more!</br>

More informations we will publish in near future (probably few days)
